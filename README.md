 AddressBook Project 
## Firstly I defined attributes of person like id, name, street, city, gender, zip. Person attributes have 
rules like name can not be greater than 32, street can not be greater than 32, city can not be 
greater than 20, gender must be F or M, zip number can not be between 1000 and 9999. Then I
created database and interface for add database and update database. Database file type is txt.
Database saving file as “id, name, street, city, gender, zip”. I created grid, textfields, labels and 
buttons. These are searching or updating id textfield, name textfield, street textfield, city 
textfield, gender textfield, zip textfield. And added buttons like add, first, next, previous, last, 
updatebyid, searchbyid, cleantextfields
